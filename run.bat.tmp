REM Compiling the Java file into a header file that shows how the native function should be defined. This header file is then linked into our C++ native library file (the .hip file)
call javac -h . Main.java

REM Taking our C++ code and turning it into a DLL/library file (note: -w is for disabling warnings)
call hipcc -shared -o native.dll -w --offload-arch=gfx1032 -mprintf-kind=buffered -Iinclude -Iinclude/win32 Main.hip

REM Running the final Java file using the current directory as the place to look for DLL files (that's what the argument does, is set the path for the library/DLL files, with the "." being the current directory of this batch file)
REM --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED to disable warnings for using System.loadLibrary()
call java "-Djava.library.path=." --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED Main.java
